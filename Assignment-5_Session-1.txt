Problem Statement

1. Create a m x n matrix with replicate (m, rnorm(n))with m=10 column vectors of n=10 elements each, 
constructed with rnorm(n), which creates random normal numbers.
Then we transform it into a dataframe (thus 10 observations of 10 variables) and perform an algebraic 
operation on each element using a nested for loop: at each iteration, every element referred by the two 
indexes is incremented by a sinusoidal function, compare the vectorized and non-vectorized form of creating 
the solution and report the system time differences.

Answer-
mat <- matrix( rnorm(10*10,mean=0,sd=1), 10, 10)
df_mat <- as.data.frame(mat)
colnames(df_mat)<- c("col1", "col2", "col3", "col4", "col5", "col6", "col7", "col8", "col9", "col10")
start_time <- Sys.time()
for(i in 1:ncol(df_mat)){
  for(j in 1:nrow(df_mat)){
    df_mat[i,j] <- df_mat[i,j] + sin(df_mat[i,j])}
}
end_time <- Sys.time()
end_time - start_time
start_time <- Sys.time()
for(i in 1:ncol(df_mat)){print(i)
  df_mat[,i] <- df_mat[,i] + sin(df_mat[,i])
}
end_time <- Sys.time()
end_time - start_time
